                ATLANTA — Unless you catch a glimpse of the eggplant
                Mercedes-Maybach S600 or the various young men with clusters of
                diamonds on choker-short chains coming and going at all hours,
                there is nothing too flashy about the headquarters of Quality
                Control Music, a record label here in the world’s de facto
                hip-hop capital.
              </p>

              <p>
                As the birthplace of the chart-topping, trendsetting careers of
                Migos and Lil Yachty, this studio and office compound, northwest
                of downtown, is the latest nondescript landmark to help alter
                the course of rap music, a near-constant occurrence in Atlanta
                over the last two decades. But despite its pedigree as a center
                of luxury and innovation, the space — tucked behind a Goodwill
                and a full-service dog care facility — is light on bacchanalia
                and heavy on rules and expectations.

                “DO NOT come to the studio UNLESS you are working,” reads a
                weathered printout taped to a bare wall amid four recording
                studios. “BE RESPONSIBLE for the company you bring … DO NOT have
                anyone dropping off or picking up drugs at the studio … This is
                not your home, this is not a hangout, this is a place of
                business. PLEASE conduct yourself accordingly and in a
                professional manner.” (Also: “ANY gambling, all parties involved
                must pay the house 30%!”)
