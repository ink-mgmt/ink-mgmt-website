        In an industry-wide study of 165 agencies representing 40,000+
        employees, Blacks make up roughly 6% of the industry. The vast majority
        of those roles are admin or entry-level, and not leadership positions.
        Through a series of initiatives we will give young Black creatives
        opportunities to succeed in meaningful ways. To start weâ€™ll take 6% of
        our placement fees and put it towards a scholarship program for Black
        creatives.
