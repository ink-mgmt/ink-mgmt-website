          In an industry-wide study of 165 agencies representing 40,000+
          employees, Blacks make up roughly 6% of the industry. The vast
          majority of those roles are admin or entry-level, and not leadership
          positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through a series of initiatives we will give young Black creatives
          opportunities to succeed in meaningful ways.

            To start we&rsquo;ll take 6% of our placement fees and put it
            towards a scholarship program for Black creatives.
